          The fur is long and dense, the undercoat is covered with a shiny thick
          and waterproof top coat. The coat on the head, neck and shoulders is
          shorter and lengthens towards the tail and flanks. On the stomach and
          "breeches", the wool is thick and shaggy. There is a collar on the
          neck from the very base of the ears, and it is larger and heavier in
          males. The fur on the tail is long and falls like waves.

          A tassel on the ears. The paws have tufts, so they resemble snowshoes.
          The Maine Coon cat breed can have more than 30 color options. The eyes
          are green, golden or copper - and white cats have blue or
          multi-colored eyes.

          Maine coons have a very pleasant character, they are playful and
          friendly. They like to be in the company of people and make excellent
          pets. Perhaps because of their undemanding origin, they often curl up
          in the most unexpected places. They like the outdoors and need the
          ability to climb and simulate hunting. Maine Coons are known for their
          charming, quiet grunt.

        <p>
          The ancestors of Maine Coon cats were long-haired cats that were
          brought to the American state of Maine by sailors in the 1850s. They
          mated with local short-haired cats. Their descendants were large, had
          a strong body, medium-length fur and brush tails similar to a
          raccoon's tail, hence the name: Maine Coon ("raccoon from the state of
          Maine").

        <p>
          To protect against the harsh local winter, these cats have grown thick
          and dense fur. Already in the 1860s, special exhibitions of Maine Coon
          cats were held, and they became very popular as pets. Maine Coons were
          brought to Great Britain in the 1980s.
